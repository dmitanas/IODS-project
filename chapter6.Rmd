# **Chapter 6. Analysis of longitudinal data**

```{r}

# Note: As you read the data sets in your chapter6.Rmd you may have to factor the categorical variables again, as R may not recognise them automatically as factors.

# Note that you must SWAP the data sets! :) It is NOT a simple copy & paste of my book!

# Implement the analyses of Chapter 8 of MABS using the RATS data. (0-7 points: 0-4 points for graphs or analysis results + 0-3 points for their interpretations)

# Implement the analyses of Chapter 9 of MABS using the BPRS data. (0-8 points: 0-4 points for graphs or analysis results + 0-4 points for their interpretations). One more time: Note the SWAP of the data sets. And feel free with the graphs!
