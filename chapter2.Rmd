# **Chapter 2. Regression and model validation**

*During this week I learned how to wrangle data, what is simple and multiple regression, and how to conduct regression diagnostics*

```{r}

students2014 <- read.table("newlearning2014.txt")

str(students2014)

dim(students2014)

# This dataset refers to the study which goal was to determine the association between students' learning styles and their academic achievements.

plot(students2014)

summary(students2014)

# It can be seen that the variable "gender" is character or categorical variable while the rest of variables are numeric ones. In all of the rest variables can be found their minimal and maximal values, the values of the 1st and 3rd quartiles, meadian and mean. 

regression_model <- lm(Points ~ Attitude + surf + stra, data = students2014)
summary(regression_model)

# The regression model shows what effect do such explanatory variables as Attitude, surf and stra have on a dependent variable such as Points. It can be seen that Attitude is the only variable which is statistically significant. It means that there is a correlation between points received for the exam and attitude towards statistics. There is no correlation between points received for the exam and surf, and stra variables. According to the task, we will remove those explanatory variables that does not have a statistically significant relationship with the target variable and fir the model again.

regression_model <- lm(Points ~ Attitude, data = students2014)
summary(regression_model)

# Beta coefficient is positive, therefore, the relationship between this independent variable and the dependent is direct - the greater the attitude was, the more points were received for the exam and vice versa. According to the results of the regression model, it can be seen that multiple R squared is equal to 19%. It means that the model explains 19% from the total variance.

plot(regression_model, which = c(1, 2, 5))

# It can be seen on the plot "Normal Q-Q" that almost all points are on the straight line, so we can assume a very good normality. But it seems there are three deviation cases such as 145, 56, 35. It can be seen on the plot "Residuals vs Fitted" that values are widely distributed but reasonably. Nevertheless, there are three deviation cases 145, 56, 35. On the plot "Residuals vs Leverage" we can see that there are values that have an unusually high impact on the model such as 71, 56, 35.
